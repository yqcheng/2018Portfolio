        <p class = "caption">Inspired by the <a class ="in-text-hightlight" href="https://huggingface.co/" target="blank">HuggingFace</a>
          chatbot, I decided to use a chatbot to achieve my goal. I wanted to
          explore more about the concepts of <a class ="in-text-hightlight" href="http://interconnected.org/home/2015/06/16/conversational_uis">“conversational interface”</a> and

          interaction with a service instead of the interface.  </p>

      <div class = "section">
        <h1 class = "title">How To Achieve The Goal?</h1>
        <p class = "caption">Application Programming Interface (API) is powerful.
          I used <a class ="in-text-hightlight" href = "https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/" target="blank">Azure Face API</a> from Microsoft to analyze emotion from user’s
          selfie, and <a class ="in-text-hightlight" href = "https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/authentication" target="blank">the Movie DB</a> movie database API to pull movie information.</p>

      <div class = "section">
        <h1 class = "title">Okay. What Is The Bot’s Personality?</h1>
        <p class = "caption">The bot is named Movie Eva. I chose this name
          because it was easy to remember, and related to what she could do.
          According to a <a class ="in-text-hightlight" href = "https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tone-voice-users/">study</a>
          on the Nielsen Norman Group, the tone of voice in the text message can impact how
          users receive the messages. I wanted Movie Eva to sound more human-like,
          friendly, delightful, and empathetic to increase her trustworthiness.</p>

      <div class = "section">
        <h1 class = "title">Design Conversation</h1>
        <p class = "caption">Before starting to code the chatbot, I mapped out
          the conversation flow of the bot, indicating the user’s reply and
          bot’s response in a more detailed and authentic level. This step also
          served as a conversation storage where I could copy the text and put it
          into the code. </p>

      <div class = "section">
        <h1 class = "title">User Testing</h1>
        <p class = "caption">I did observation with the
          <a class ="in-text-hightlight" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/thinking-aloud-the-1-usability-tool/">Think-aloud protocol</a>
          with 10 users. I found out that users tended to ask for out-of-range
          requests without following the prompts. Some users wanted more casual conversation,
          which was not planned in the conversation flow. So two takeaways:
        </br>
</br>1.  Diversify the way of searching
</br>2.  Refine conversation to support casual chat</p>

        <h1 class = "title">What Did I Learn?</h1>
        <h2 class = "sec-title">1.  Need more time for user research</h2>
        <p class = "caption">Since this a 4-week long class project, I did not have enough time to do a
comprehensive user research with a bigger sample size and more diverse user
representations. With more research data, I will be more accurate matching movies for moods.</p>
        <h2 class = "sec-title">2. Insufficient user testing</h2>
        <p class = "caption">
          This chatbot only went through 3 times of iteration, mainly focusing
          on the usage of API. However, I would like to focus more on the conversation flow in the future.</p>
        <h2 class = "sec-title">3. Inexpierienced with Dialogflow API</h2>
        <p class = "caption">
            My original plan was to design conversations in the application,
            <a class ="in-text-hightlight" href="https://dialogflow.com/">Dialogflow</a>, and use it’s API in my Ruby code to provide users with
            better communication. However, the plan failed because I didn’t have
            enough time to experiment with the API. In my next step, utilizing
            Dialogflow will be my focus. </p>
